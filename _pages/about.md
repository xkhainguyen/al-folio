I am a graduate student the [MS in Mechanical Engineeringâ€“Research](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/education/graduate-programs/masters-research.html) program at [Carnegie Mellon Univeristy (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am advised by [Zac Manchester](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/zachary-manchester/) as a member of the [Robotic Exploration Lab](http://roboticexplorationlab.org/), in the [Robotics Institute](https://ri.cmu.edu/). I am working on optimization-first approaches for real-time planning and control of robotic systems.

I am currently a [Vingroup Scholar](https://scholarships.vinuni.edu.vn/) with the mission to lead and advance the development of science and technology in Vietnam in the future.

Previously, I graduated with a BS in [Control Engineering and Automation (Talent Program)](https://seee.hust.edu.vn/en_US/talented) from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://en.hust.edu.vn/) where I was advised by Prof. Phuong Nam Dao. My undergraduate research focused on the intersection of control theory and reinforcement learning. Besides, I have two years of experience with Viettel Aerospace Institute as an Autopilot Engineer, where I collaborated with multiple teams on high-speed aerial vehicle development.

<h2>research</h2>

I am interested in `control`, `optimization`, `dynamics` and `robot learning`. I am developing efficient optimization-based planning algorithms for real-time embedded systems.
