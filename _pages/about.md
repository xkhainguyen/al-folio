I am a first-year student the [MS in Mechanical Engineeringâ€“Research](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/education/graduate-programs/masters-research.html) program at [Carnegie Mellon Univeristy (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am advised by [Zac Manchester](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/zachary-manchester/) as a member of the [Robotic Exploration Lab](http://roboticexplorationlab.org/), in the [Robotics Institute](https://ri.cmu.edu/). I am working on trajectory optimization and model predictive control (MPC) for autonomous vehicles.

I am currently a [Vingroup Scholar](https://scholarships.vinuni.edu.vn/) with the mission to lead and advance the development of science and technology in Vietnam in the future.

Previously, I graduated with a BS in [Control Engineering and Automation (Talent Program)](https://seee.hust.edu.vn/en_US/talented) from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://en.hust.edu.vn/) where I was advised by Prof. Phuong Nam Dao. My undergraduate research focused on the intersection of control theory and reinforcement learning. Besides, I have two years of experience with Viettel Aerospace Institute as an Autopilot Engineer, where I collaborated with multiple teams on high-speed aerial vehicle development.

In my free time, I love to cook, golf, hike, and travel, among many other things.
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
