I graduated from the [MS in Mechanical Engineering--Research](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/education/graduate-programs/masters-research.html) program at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy. I was advised by [Zac Manchester](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/zachary-manchester/) as a member of the [Robotic Exploration Lab](http://roboticexplorationlab.org/), in the Robotics Institute. I worked with [Jesus Tordesillas](http://www.mit.edu/~jtorde/) and [Marco Hutter](https://rsl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people.html) in the [Robotic Systems Lab](https://rsl.ethz.ch/), ETH Zurich within the Robotics Student Fellowship.

<h2>research</h2>

My PhD goal is to address fundamental challenges in robot control and learning by: **(i) leveraging structure for efficient and generalizable modeling and decision-making**, **(ii) closing the loop between offline design and online adaptation**, and **(ii) providing formal performance guarantees in the real world, around humans**. 

Iâ€™m open to exploring various theoretical and practical aspects of robotics, drawing on my background in control theory, differentiable optimization, and machine learning.
