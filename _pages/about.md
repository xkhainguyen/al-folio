I am currently involved in several projects, featuring AI-powered humanoid robots, model predictive path integral control, and implicit deep learning.

I graduated from the [MS in Mechanical Engineering--Research](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/education/graduate-programs/masters-research.html) program at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy. I was advised by [Zac Manchester](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/zachary-manchester/) as a member of the [Robotic Exploration Lab](http://roboticexplorationlab.org/), in the Robotics Institute. I worked with [Jesus Tordesillas](http://www.mit.edu/~jtorde/) and [Marco Hutter](https://rsl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people.html) in the [Robotic Systems Lab](https://rsl.ethz.ch/), ETH Zurich within the Robotics Student Fellowship.

<!-- I am a [Vingroup Scholar](https://scholarships.vinuni.edu.vn/) with the mission to lead and advance the development of science and technology in Vietnam in the future. -->

Previously, I graduated with a [BS in Control Engineering and Automation--Talent Program](https://seee.hust.edu.vn/en_US/talented) from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://en.hust.edu.vn/). I have ~2 years of experience in autopilot systems with Viettel Aerospace Institute.

<h2>research</h2>

I am driven by elegant solution methods in robot learning and control that target high performance, safety guarantees, data efficiency, and robust generalizationâ€”key milestones toward embodied intelligence.

I am open to exploring various theoretical and practical aspects of robotics, drawing on my background in control theory, differentiable optimization, and machine learning.
