I am a graduate student in the [MS in Mechanical Engineering--Research](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/education/graduate-programs/masters-research.html) program at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy (CMU). I am advised by [Zac Manchester](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/zachary-manchester/) as a member of the [Robotic Exploration Lab](http://roboticexplorationlab.org/), in the [Robotics Institute](https://ri.cmu.edu/). I worked with [Jesus Tordesillas](http://www.mit.edu/~jtorde/) and [Marco Hutter](https://rsl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people.html) in the [Robotic Systems Lab](https://rsl.ethz.ch/), ETH Zurich in Summer 2023.

I am currently a [Vingroup Scholar](https://scholarships.vinuni.edu.vn/) with the mission to lead and advance the development of science and technology in Vietnam in the future.

Previously, I graduated with a [BS in Control Engineering and Automation--Talent Program](https://seee.hust.edu.vn/en_US/talented) from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://en.hust.edu.vn/). I have ~2 years of experience with Viettel Aerospace Institute as an Autopilot Engineer.

<h2>research</h2>

My research focuses on the intersection of `control`, `optimization`, and `learning`, aiming to create novel theoretical frameworks and efficient computational machinery for *safe and agile robotics*.
