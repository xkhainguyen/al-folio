I graduated from the [MS in Mechanical Engineering--Research](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/education/graduate-programs/masters-research.html) program at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy. I was advised by [Zac Manchester](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/zachary-manchester/) as a member of the [Robotic Exploration Lab](http://roboticexplorationlab.org/), in the Robotics Institute. I worked with [Jesus Tordesillas](http://www.mit.edu/~jtorde/) and [Marco Hutter](https://rsl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people.html) in the [Robotic Systems Lab](https://rsl.ethz.ch/), ETH Zurich within the Robotics Student Fellowship.

Previously, I graduated with a [BS in Control Engineering and Automation--Talent Program](https://seee.hust.edu.vn/en_US/talented) from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://en.hust.edu.vn/). I have ~2 years of experience in autopilot systems with Viettel Aerospace Institute.

<h2>research</h2>

My PhD goal is to address fundamental robotics problems where I can **(i) leverage structure for efficient and generalizable modeling and decision-making**, e.g. contact-rich manipulation, and <strong>(ii) close the loop between offline design and online adaptation</strong>, e.g. sim<->real. I am driven by structured scaling for robot learning to enable data efficiency, high performance, and out-of-distribution generalizationâ€”key steps toward achieving embodied intelligence
