    We introduce a benchmark for learning robot agility on low-priced robots. Our study assesses both specialist and generalist policies, enabling robots to (a) traverse challenging terrain by (b) walking robustly, (c, d) climbing up and down high obstacles, (e) leaping over long gaps, and (f) crossing narrow beams only using one-side legs.

**Abstract**---The motivation for this project stems from the growing interest and importance of agile robots in various fields, including entertainment, search and rescue operations, and everyday tasks. As robots become more integrated into human environments, their ability to navigate complex and dynamic environments becomes crucial. Understanding whether a generalist or specialist approach is more effective in robotic parkour has direct implications for real-world applications. For instance, a generalist robot may be more versatile in handling different types of obstacles commonly found in various environments, while a specialist robot may excel in specific parkour scenarios. Knowing which approach is more effective can guide the development of robots for specific tasks or environments.
By addressing these motivations, the project can contribute valuable insights to the field of robotics and help advance the development of robots that are capable of navigating and interacting with complex environments effectively.
