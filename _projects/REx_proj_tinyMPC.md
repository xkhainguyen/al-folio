This is my current project at the Robotic Exploration Lab at CMU. I am developing TinyMPC, a lightweight, dependency-free MPC framework, designed for embedded applications, enabling faster computation times and reducing resource consumption.

In the first attempt, we used conventional augmented Lagrangian with LQR method ([Github repository](https://github.com/RoboticExplorationLab/TinyMPC-AL)).
However, this approach was not fast enough. We decided to switch to ADMM and currently see promosing results.

Stay tuned for further updates!
