This is my previous set of projects at the Advanced Control and Robotics at Hanoi University of Science and Technology. Several papers are listed in [publications](/../publications){:target="_blank"} page. Some key points:

- Explored motion/force robust controller for multiple mobile manipulators to accomplish co-operative tasks.
- Integrated control theory to boost stability and robustness of reinforcement learning algorithms by 66%.
- Devised hierarchical formation control for multi-agent systems; scaled up and simulated with MATLAB/Simulink.
