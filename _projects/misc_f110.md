I was a core member of CMU's F1TENTH team. Based on the [F1TENTH platform](https://f1tenth.org/), we built a 1:10 scaled autonomous race car and developed autonomy software including SLAM, state estimation, raceline optimization, and tracking control. It is able to perform head-to-head racing and reach maximum velocity of 20 km/h. I participated in the [competition](https://cps2023-race.f1tenth.org/) in San Antonio within the Cyber-Physical Systems and Internet-of-Things Week in May 2023 and the team advanced to semi-final.

During my involvement, I worked on integrated planning and control from simulation to hardware. Things I used for the project

- SLAM: ROS 2 slam_toolbox
- State estimation: [particle filter](https://github.com/mit-racecar/particle_filter)
- Raceline optimization: [TUM software](https://github.com/TUMFTM/global_racetrajectory_optimization)
- Control: gap-following, wall-following, PID, pure-pursuit, MPC.

Note: we ended up using simple methods for the race.
