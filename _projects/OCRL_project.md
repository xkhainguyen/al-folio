**Abstract**---We introduce a novel model predictive control
(MPC) framework designed for running on low-resource hardware. Our approach utilizes an Augmented Lagrangian-iLQR
optimization method to handle trajectory optimization and
constraint management. The framework is optimized to run on
several microcontrollers, including the Teensy 4.1, STM32F401,
and the Crazyflie 2.1 drone, which uses an STM32F405
processor. We detail the algorithm implementation, hardware
optimization techniques, and provide a comparison of the
frameworkâ€™s runtime performance with other state-of-the-art
solvers. Additionally, we present the results of testing the
framework on the Crazyflie 2.1 drone, which shows that it
can solve the full-state quadrotor problem with a minimum
frequency of 16Hz, while a complementary LQR is implemented
to stabilize the drone at 50Hz.

## Introduction

In recent years, significant strides have been made in
the field of robotics, particularly in deep learning (DL)
and reinforcement learning (RL), resulting in a range of
improved capabilities and applications. However,
these advanced techniques often demand significant computing resources, which can pose challenges for many robotic
applications. This stands in contrast to a significant portion
of robotics that utilizes embedded systems with severely
limited computing resources. These systems include palmsized toy robots like the Crazyflie quadrotor and the
Petoi Bittle quadruped, as well as mission-critical robots
like NASAâ€™s Mars Perseverance rove. The Crazyflie
and Bittle employ affordable and accessible commercial
microcontrollers, such as families of STM32 and Teensy,
respectively. Meanwhile, the Perseverance rover relies on
RAD750, a radiation-hardened version of the PowerPC 750
processor from the previous century. Clearly, the need for
resource-constrained robotic applications is widespread. Operating within a tight computational budget, these embedded
systems require innovative approaches to enable the efficacy
of advanced techniques.

Our contributions to the field of optimal control are
three-fold. Firstly, we have developed a highly efficient and
extensible open-source optimal control solver in C. Secondly,
we have created a user-friendly MPC interface that simplifies
the setup and compilation of our solver on various hardware
platforms. Finally, we have provided benchmark results to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and a hardware
demonstration to showcase its practicality.

## Design

### Constrained Optimal Control Problem

Up to this point, we have not considered any constraints on
the state x or input u. Real-world systems have many types
of physical or desired limitations. Some popular constraints
are box constraints on the state and input at each time step
(to ensure that the solution is realizable on hardware and to
encourage smoothness in the solution), equality constraints
on the goal state (to ensure that that a desired final position is
reached), and second-order cone constraints to, for example,
enforce thrust limits.

To handle constraints, we use the augmented Lagrangian
method (ALM) which enforces constraints into the cost
function. Generally, our tracking problem is convex, and
a global solution can be found with only one constrained
backward pass. However, multiple iterations are needed to
satisfy dual feasibility.
Below is the pseudo-code of our AL-TVLQR algorithm.

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

Note the subtle difference between AL here and in iterative
LQR (iLQR). In iLQR, one will naturally approximate the
cost with second-order Taylor expansion about the current
trajectory, then group the cost in gradient and Hessian
terms, not precisely like linear and quadratic terms like ours.
Third-rank tensors are ignored. Moreover, one will solve the
backward pass and forward pass iteratively until convergence
so that any mismatch due to nonlinearity can be eliminated.
Constraints have to be in linear form so they can be
substituted and grouped into corresponding terms.

### The TinyMPC Framework

Functions to compute state and control matrices were generated using `Symbolics.jl` in Julia by symbolically compute the Jacobians of the given robotâ€™s dynamics function
with respect to the state control variables. These symbolic
functions were converted to C functions. Reference trajectories were generated using ALTRO and similarly copied into
C code format for use on a microcontroller.

We use the SLAP (Simple Linear Algebra Protocols)
library developed by Dr. Brian Jackson for matrix computations. SLAP was chosen because it is tested and lightweight
and because of our architectural decision to have as few
dependencies as possible. We modified SLAP, to replace the backend of some of the most commonly
used functions with existing implementations that are much
faster and can be precompiled for use with SLAP.

## Results

After having verified the correctness of our algorithm by
comparing it with the solution from ALTRO in Julia, we
chose to implement our algorithm on three common and
accessible microcontrollers as a demonstration of the range
of embedded systems on which our solution can run. We
chose to implement our algorithm on a Teensy 4.1, an STM
NucleoF401RE, and an STMF405 on a Crazyflie 2.1. The Crazyflie drone is a common research
platform for autonomous and distributed swarm algorithm
research. We chose to use it because it is small and thus has
fast attitude dynamics that we want to show can be stabilized
by TinyMPC.

### Speed Increases

After profiling our C implementation, we found the algorithm was spending around
77% of its time in the SLAP, the library we used as our
matrix processing backend. Specifically, the algorithm was
in the matrix add and multiply function around 75% of the time. This function multiplies two matrices, multiplies
them by a scalar, then sums the result with a third matrix
multiplied by a second scalar to produce a final result. To
speed up our implementation, we replaced the original SLAP
implementation with Eigen 3.1 matrices. This adds a new
dependency to our implementation, but since it is added as a
backend to the SLAP library, users can simply download a
precompiled version of SLAP and not need to worry about
downloading and compiling Eigen themselves. Replacing the
SLAP backend with Eigen halved the runtime of our MPC
function, allowing us to run the dynamic bicycle model in
real time (faster than 50Hz) with a horizon length of 4 knot
points. This speed increase is still not
enough to run the quadrotor at 50Hz, even with only two
knot points in the horizon.

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

We take advantage of the
constantly updating nature of MPC and the fact that knot
points farther into the future do not have to be predicted
as accurately as those closer to the current state of the
robot by increasing the time step for later knot points. This
allows the MPC algorithm to cover the same amount of
horizon time using fewer knot points, decreasing runtime
while achieving similar performance. This works primarily because the fast dynamics of the system need to be stabilized
immediately while obstacle avoidance, which relies more on
computing the position of the robot, generally has slower
dynamics and thus can be computed using a larger time
step. On the quadrotor, this was implemented by linearizing
two dynamics functions about hover, one with the initial
fast time step and one with the slow time step used for
the remainder of the horizon time.

The results in figures show results from running
on the STM NucleoF401RE. The F401RE uses a Cortex M4
processor running at a maximum clock frequency of 16 MHz.
The function runtimes from this processor are far too slow
to be run on the Crazyflie quadrotor. The exact same code
was run on a Teensy 4.1 in a fraction of the time. The Teensy 4.1 uses a Cortex M7 chip that, in
our tests, was run at a clock frequency of 600 MHz. This
is the highest natively supported clock frequency that does
not require active cooling. The Teensy ran our MPC code
in under 1 millisecond for each horizon length shown in
the figure. With 130 knot points for the horizon length, the
Teensy ran the function in 20 milliseconds, which is an MPC
runtime frequency of 50Hz. This is the same frequency used
to control the drone using LQR, and is promising given weâ€™re
able to run the Cortex M4 on the Crazyflie at the speed of
the Teensy 4.1.

Because our MPC algorithm does not yet run fast enough
to control a quadrotor, we opted to solve for the infinite
horizon LQR gains for the model we obtained from Bitcraze,
the developers of the Crazyflie, and implement our own
controller on their software stack. Directly copying the
optimal gain matrix obtained from infinite horizon LQR
caused the drone to exhibit a stable, sinusoidal wobbling
behavior during flight. This wobbling was removed by handtuning the optimal gain matrix. We then generated position
and velocity knot points for a figure-8 trajectory we wanted
the drone to follow. Although the drone did not follow the
trajectory properly, it did stay in the air for the duration of
the trajectory.

## Conclusions

The hardware results above highlight the computational
complexities of running an MPC algorithm in real-time on
an underpowered micro controller. We have demonstrated
that our algorithm may run in real-time on devices like the
Teensy 4.1 which runs on a Cortex M7 processor running at
up to 1GHz. There is still work to do to demonstrate these
results on power and resource constrained devices such as
the Crazyflie 2.1 running a Cortex M4 chip.
We have not yet reduced the runtime of our algorithm to
the point where it may be run on the Crazyflieâ€™s processor
in real-time, but there are a few things we can implement to
speed up our algorithm.
Our future work is proposed as below:

Algorithm: We plan to create a new version of the
solver using ADMM rather than AL to help reduce the
required online computation. ADMM will require fewer
matrix-matrix multiplications (from matrix factorizations),
which is primarily what is slowing down our code.

Conic Constraints: We have attempted to incorporate
conic constraint handling, but this is still a work in progress.

Model Hierarchy Predictive Control: An additional
method implemented to increase performance is a hierarchical dynamics model scheme, where the first few time
steps use the full model dynamics and the remainder use
increasingly simplified versions of the robotâ€™s dynamics.
This can be done for similar reasons as variable sampling
time. Doing this reduces the computational complexity of the Jacobians for later time steps
which decreases overall runtime. Time steps closer to the
first horizon knot point require higher-accuracy dynamics to
correctly determine the robotâ€™s future state, but later time
steps only need to look at low frequency dynamics since
the higher frequency dynamics will likely be incorrectly
estimated anyway. These low frequency dynamics tend to
be attributed to much simpler models, such as point mass
models, and can be used to determine a subset of the robotâ€™s
state farther into the future, such as its center of mass. Often,
center of mass is all that is required when trying to avoid
obstacles farther into the future.

Code Generation: Following applications like OSQP,
Simulink, and SLinGen, we would like to be able to generate
C code from a higher level programming language. The
overhead of extra work required to do this pays off in the
form of a much simpler user interface and being able to
optimize for a wide variety of specific platforms using a
single program.
