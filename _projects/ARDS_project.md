**Abstract**---We explore sampling-based sum-of-squares (SOS) programming as a technique to verify the stability of nonlinear systems. We provide a review of Lyapunov analysis, traditional SOS stability verification, and sampling-based SOS verification, then apply these methods to two nonlinear systems. We demonstrate that sampling-based SOS verification offers significant advantages over the traditional formulation in terms of problem size and the amount of time required to obtain a solution. The code for this project is available at [link](https://github.com/EpicDuckPotato/final_project_16715.git).

## Introduction

Deploying robots into dangerous environments and environments with humans requires ensuring that their operation
is safe. One control-theoretic notion of safety is stabilityâ€“the
property that within some range of operating conditions, the
robot can be trusted to track desired trajectories or drive itself
to a desired operating point. Recently, there has been a great
deal of work in verifying stability using sum-or-squares (SOS)
programming, which expresses Lyapunov stability conditions
as nonnegativity conditions for sets of polynomials.  A
problem with the traditional SOS approach is its scalabiltiy
to higher-dimensional systems, particularly due to its reliance
on high-degree Lagrange multiplier polynomials for representing constraints, leading to large semidefinite programs.
This is restrictive since there are many intriguing real-world
applications that are far larger than 10-15 states, such as
mechanical systems made up of several rigid bodies. Various
techniques have been used to address this problem, e.g. DSOS
and SDSOS programming.

In this project, we examine a recent sampling-based method
of SOS programming that addresses the scalability problem
in [[html]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9304028), and compare it to the traditional SOS approach.

## Methods

### Lyapunov Stability Analysis

Suppose we have the following autonomous dynamical
system

$$
\dot{x} = f(x)
$$

and want to verify the asymptotic stability of the origin $$x = 0$$.
These dynamics might represent the closed-loop dynamics of
a controller attempting to drive the systemâ€™s state to the origin.
Lyapunov analysis proceeds by searching for a Lyapunov
function V that satisfies the following two conditions:

$$
V(x) > 0, \dot{V}(x) < 0
$$

If such a function exists, then the origin x = 0 is asymptotically stable.
For many systems, however, the origin is only stable within
some region of attraction (ROA).

### Stability Verification via Sum-of-Squares Programming

SOS stability analysis makes the assumption that $$V$$ and
$$f$$ are polynomial functions of x. In practice, we formulate
candidate Lyapunov functions $$V$$ using the systemâ€™s total
energy or the value function of an LQR controller, which are
already polynomial. If the dynamics $$f$$ are not polynomial, we
can approximate them as polynomial using a Taylor expansion.

### Stability Verification via Sampling-based Sum-of-Squares Programming

Beside the popular SOS programming formulation described above, which is based on inequality implication (4), Sprocedure and multipliers, there is also an equality-constrained formulation. Define an *algebraic variety* as the set of solutions to a set of polynomial equations. The number of equations in the
variety is the number of *components*. The core idea behind
sampling-based SOS verification is that instead of solving the
optimization problem for all real-valued $$x$$, we only solve it
at a set of numerical samples $$\{x_i\}$$ in the algebraic variety.

## Results

We verify both standard and sample-based methods derived
above by comparing solve time and ROA values compared to
ground truth which could be found by rolling out closed-loop
system simulations.
Van der Pol is a 2 state, degree 3 polynomial system.

We first simulate the system on an interesting grid for a
certain amount of time. In this way, stable states could be
found within some tolerances. The result from simulationbased verification is described in the Figure. Intuitively, if one needs better quality ROA using simulation, the complexity
would increase exponentially with respect to problem dimension, grid size and converging time. This is why SDP
programs are preferred for this ROA application. While the
standard SOS program is not trivial to set up, the samplingbased one is simpler but in need of an efficient sampling
method. The samples must be well-distributed, generic and not
close to zeros (trivial solution) to find a non-zero ROA. Both
programs are solved with Mosek using a degree 4 candidate
V , resulting in good approximations. If the degree
of the candidate V is increased, tighter ROA approximations
could be found.

We also applied sampling-based SOS verification to an N-link
cartpole. We assume that the cart, as well as all joints, except for the
$$N$$th joint, are actuated, linearize the dynamics in the original
coordinates, and design an infinite-horizon LQR controller
$$\tau(q, v)$$ to drive the full cartpole state, consisting of configuration and velocity, to zero. The trajectory induced by the controller from a perturbed initial condition, in the plane of
the cart position and joint angle ($$N = 1$$ here).

## Conclusions

In this project, we compared a recent sampling-based variant
of SOS stability verification to a more traditional form of
SOS stability verification, applied to a Van der Pol oscillator.
Ground truth for the system was found by using simulationbased method. We found that the sampling-based variant
produced a smaller program and took less time to solve.
It may also provide less conservative ROA compared with
the standard approach. We also applied sampling-based SOS
verification to an N-link cartpole. Future directions of research
include applying the sampling-based verification to higherdimensional systems. In particular, systems with contacts
would be an interesting application, since they require many
multipliers with the traditional SOS formulation, creating
large SOS programs.
